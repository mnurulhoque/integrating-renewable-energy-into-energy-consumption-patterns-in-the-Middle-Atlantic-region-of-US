# Analytical visualization of integrating renewable energy into energy consumption patterns in the Middle Atlantic region of the US

# Project Overview
Graphical visualization techniques have been employed to assess the impact of integrating renewable energy into energy consumption patterns in the Middle Atlantic region of the United States, particularly emphasizing New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. Utilizing data spanning from 2001 to 2022, these visualizations offered insights into the evolving relationship between renewable energy adoption and energy consumption trends within this region. 

# Data Cleaning
In the initial data preparation phase, the following data cleaning tasks were performed:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values and formatting 

# Exploratory Data Analysis
First, an exploratory analysis was conducted to observe the distribution, median, and trend of the selected variables. 

## Distribution of total energy consumption and total renewable energy generation data

The states' median energy usage varies, as can be seen from the box plot of total energy consumption. Pennsylvanian and New Jerseyan data are skewed to the right. The majority of the data is focused on the lower end of the energy usage spectrum. However, the majority of the data for New York is concentrated on the higher range of total energy usage, and the data are therefore biased. The median generation in this case varies by state as well, according to the box plot of the total amount of renewable energy generated. New Jersey and New York's data exhibit a right-skewed distribution. The majority of the data is focused on the lower end of the spectrum for the overall generation of renewable energy. Data in Pennsylvania are essentially regularly distributed. Finally, there is no outlier data in both distributions.

The violin charts demonstrate how the states' overall energy use differs from one another. New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania have median energy consumptions of 295098, 574677.50, and 95487 megawatts, respectively.

The violin charts demonstrate how the states' overall amounts of renewable energy generation differ from one another. New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania had median renewable energy generation of 962.50, 5014, and 4331.50 megawatts, respectively.
