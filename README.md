# Analytical visualization of integrating renewable energy into energy consumption patterns in the Middle Atlantic region of the US

# Project Overview
Graphical visualization techniques have been employed to assess the impact of integrating renewable energy into energy consumption patterns in the Middle Atlantic region of the United States, particularly emphasizing New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. Utilizing data spanning from 2001 to 2022, these visualizations offered insights into the evolving relationship between renewable energy adoption and energy consumption trends within this region.
