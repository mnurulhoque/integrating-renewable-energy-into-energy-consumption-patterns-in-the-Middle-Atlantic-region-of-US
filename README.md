# Analytical visualization of integrating renewable energy into energy consumption patterns in the Middle Atlantic region of the US

# Project Overview
Graphical visualization techniques have been employed to assess the impact of integrating renewable energy into energy consumption patterns in the Middle Atlantic region of the United States, particularly emphasizing New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. Utilizing data spanning from 2001 to 2022, these visualizations offered insights into the evolving relationship between renewable energy adoption and energy consumption trends within this region. 

# Data Cleaning
In the initial data preparation phase, the following data cleaning tasks have been performed:
-> Data loading and inspection
-> Handling missing values and formating 

# Exploratory Data Analysis
First, an exploratory analysis was conducted to observe the distribution, median, and trend of the selected variables.
